In next-to-leading order a new production mechanism enters that is induced by a light quark, so we have to consider the process
\begin{equation}
\Pggx(q) + \Pq(k_1) \rightarrow \PQ(p_1)+\PaQ(p_2) + \Pq(k_2)
\end{equation}
All contributing diagrams are depicted in figure \fxerror{do} and the result can be written as
\begin{equation}
\hat {\mathcal P}_{k}^{\Pgg,\mu\mu'}\hat {\mathcal P}_{k}^{\Pq}\sum_{j,j'}{\Md^{(1),q}_{j,\mu}\Md^{(1),q}_{j',\mu'}}^* = 8g^4\mu_D^{-2\epsilon}e^2 N_C C_F\left( e_H^2 A_{k,1} +  e_L^2 A_{k,2} +  e_L e_H A_{k,3} \right)
\end{equation}
where $e_L$ denotes the charge of the light quark $q$ in units of $e$.

The results agree in the photo-production limit ($q^2\rightarrow 0$) with \cite{Bojak:1998zm}.
