This work is mainly based on the paper \enquote{Complete {$O(\alpha_S)$} corrections to heavy-flavour structure functions in electroproduction} by Laenen et. al.\cite{Laenen1993162} - that is, it recalculates all properties and formulas. It extends then the application to the equivalent \textit{polarized} processes. The treating of the polarized processes can for example be found in \cite{Bojak:2000eu} and we will use many ideas and technices from there.
